Typescript cannot be interpreted directly by the browser
it needs to be compiled using Typescript transpiler/compiler (TSC)

Typescript + Transpile/compile = javascript

TypeScript Compiler (tsc)
Written in TypeScript itself.
Compiles .ts files to .js files.
Installed as an NPM package (NodeJS).
Supports ES6 syntax.
