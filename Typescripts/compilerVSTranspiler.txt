Compiler : takes source code written in one language and produce output file in some other language.
  gcc is c compiler which takes the C code as input and produces binary executable (machine code ) as output.

  Trannspilers:: transpilers are source-source compilers. They are like subset of compilers.
  They take source as input and convert it to another source code file in some other language or a different version of the same language
Output is understandable by human.


If you think of layers of abstraction as this example:

(1) CPU-level (actual logic gates on the CPU)
(2) machine code
(3) assembly code
(4) [C/C++, JVM/bytecode]
(5) [JavaScript, Python]
A compiler goes to a lower level (lower number). A transpiler switches from one language (or version of a language) to another at the same number.
