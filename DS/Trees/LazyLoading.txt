Lazy loading is a strategy to Identify resources as as non-blocking(critical) and load these only when needed.
Its a way to shorten the critical rendering path which translates to reduced loading times.

Loading attribute
The loading attribute on an <img> element, or the loading attribute on an <iframe>, 
can be used to instruct the browser to defer loading of images/iframes that are off-screen until 
the user scrolls near them. This allows non-critical resources to load only if needed, potentially speeding up initial page loads and reducing network usage.

<img loading="lazy" src="image.jpg" alt="..." />
<iframe loading="lazy" src="video-player.html" title="..."></iframe>
